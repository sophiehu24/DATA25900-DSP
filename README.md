# DATA25900-DSP

**Project Guidelines**

DSP -- Privacy Engineer at Company X
A common theme among many online platforms is that they will use the data you provide them to create recommendations that will be appealing to you. If they succeed, you learn about content interesting to you, and they keep you engaged (giving them more data). For example, Spotify will learn your music taste and recommend other music you may like. Netflix will do the same. And this is the case with TikTok, Instagram, Meta, Google, and more.
In this DSP, you play the role of a 'privacy engineer' working for Company X. Company X is revising their data collection practices and wants you to help them understand users' perception of their service. Your task is to answer the following questions:
are users comfortable with the service's privacy defaults? i.e., do Company X users complain about the privacy terms?
are users aware of the data Company X collects about them?
suppose the users did not know the data Company X collects about them. Would their privacy concerns be more serious after explaining to them that Company X does, indeed, collect data about them?
and finally, will users' privacy concerns grow if they see the data Company X collects about each of them?
Goal: Company X wants you to i) answer those questions, ii) make an informed recommendation on what actions to take based on your observations; and iii) offer evidence for your decision-making process.

**My project**

I chose Yelp as my Company X. I conducted a survey to understand whether users are comfortable with the privacy defaults. 
The link to the survey used is as follows: https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2iA7O7nUwXjJeDQ 
This GitHub page contains my "software packaging", including the csv file of the responses from the survey, my notebook for analyzing the sample distributions and creating visualizations, a copy of my executive summary, and the report created by Qualtrics for comparison.
